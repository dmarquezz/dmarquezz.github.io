Hi, I'm Daniel, an aspiring web developer currently learning a handful of programming languages and technologies in order to reach my goal. 
I began coding when I started taking Java classes at City College of San Francisco a couple of semsters ago. 
During the summer I've been taking advantage of [Code Academy][codeacademy] to learn and hone HTML/CSS, JavaScript + jQuery, and Ruby, and I created this blog using [Jekyll][jekyll], which will teach me Markdown and allow me to develop my CSS skills. 
I've also recently applied to [App Academy][appacademy], an intensive 12-week program that gives students the skills needed to begin a career as a web developer. 

I want to use this _blog_ as more of a journal to talk about the things I'm learning as I embark on the journey to becoming a full fledged developer.
Eventually, I hope that this _blog/journal_ will become a place for me to talk about open source projects I will contribute to as well as personal projects, and to give tricks and tips so that others can learn from my experience. 

For now, my first project will be giving this blog a more creative layout, and getting a good grasp on Ruby in order to do well in the [App Academy][appacademy] application process.
